# 2192A-String-Rotation-Game

**Problem:** [2192A-String-Rotation-Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/2192/problem/A)

**time limit per test:** 1 second

**memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes

---

Define a block in a string as a contiguous substring of characters of the same type that cannot be extended either to the left or the right. For example, in the string aabcccdaa, there are five blocks:

 
-  aa (1-st to 2-nd characters) 
-  b (3-rd character) 
-  ccc (4-th to 6-th characters) 
-  d (7-th character) 
-  aa (8-th to 9-th characters). 
You are playing a game where you are given a string s of length n. You can cyclically rotate^{\text{∗}} the string however you want. Your score is then calculated as the number of blocks in the final string. Please find the maximum score possible.

^{\text{∗}}Formally, choose an index 1 ≤q i ≤q n, and replace the string s_1s_2… s_n with the string s_{i+1}s_{i+2}… s_ns_1s_2… s_{i}. For example, the string abcde can be rotated to string deabc by choosing i=3.


**Input**

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line of each test case contains the string s of length n.

Strings s consist of lowercase Latin characters only.


**Output**

For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the maximum score you can achieve.


**Example**

**Input**

```
4
4
abcd
4
abbc
4
abba
6
abbccc
```

**Output**

```
4
4
3
4
```


**Note**

In the first test case, score of the original string abcd is 4. It can be shown that a score greater than 4 cannot be achieved.

In the second test case, cyclically rotating the string by 2 positions will give us string bcab. Score of this string is 4. It can be shown that a score greater than 4 cannot be achieved.
